# Blueprints from the AI Infrastructure Alliance

This repo contains the blueprint diagrams from the AI Infrastructure Alliance. It includes the blank versions that anyone can feel free to adapt for their own purposes and use in their own literature, as well as different configurations of a canonical stack for machine learning, as well as representations of where different projects and companies fit in the blueprints.

The easiest way to update the files is via the Figma versions of the files, located in the [Figma Files directory](https://neuro-inc.github.io/blueprints/tree/main/figma-files)

# Neu.ro-related interactive versions of blueprints

Please retain the AIIA Logo on the diagrams when you use them, otherwise you are free to modify them in any way you see fit.
